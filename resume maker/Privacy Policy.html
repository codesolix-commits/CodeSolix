  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 10, 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Organization:</strong> Code Solix</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to the <strong>AI Resume Maker App</strong> by <strong>Code Solix</strong>. Your privacy is important to us.
    This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, who we share it with, and your rights regarding that information.
    By using the app you agree to the terms of this policy.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We may collect the following types of information when you use the app:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> Name and email address only if you voluntarily provide them (for support, account, or purchase purposes).</li>
    <li><strong>Resume Content:</strong> The text and fields you enter into resume templates or forms (e.g., work history, education, skills, projects). This is used to build, score, and export your resume.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage & Analytics:</strong> Non-identifying information about how you use the app (features used, template choices, time spent, crashes) to help us improve the app.</li>
    <li><strong>Device & Technical Data:</strong> Device model, OS version, app version, and unique identifiers for analytics and crash reporting.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use collected information to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the resume creation features and templates.</li>
    <li>Generate, score, and provide AI-driven suggestions for your resume (AI Resume Score & improvement tips).</li>
    <li>Enable export of resumes to PDF, JPG, and PNG formats.</li>
    <li>Deliver customer support and respond to inquiries.</li>
    <li>Analyze usage to improve templates, UI/UX, and performance, and to diagnose technical issues.</li>
    <li>Comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms of Service.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. AI Processing & Resume Content</h2>
  <p>
    The app's AI features (resume scoring and suggestions) analyze the resume content you provide. Resume content is processed to produce the score and tailored recommendations.
    <strong>This processing is necessary for the app’s core functionality</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    By default, resume data you enter is stored locally on your device. If you choose to enable cloud backup, synchronization, or premium features that require server-side processing, your resume data may be securely transmitted to and stored on our servers or trusted third-party service providers to provide those features.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Data Sharing and Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or trade your personal information. We may share data in limited situations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> Trusted third parties (e.g., analytics, crash reporting, cloud storage, payment processors, or Firebase/Google services) who help provide the app and are contractually bound to protect your data.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> When required by law, regulation, or legal process to protect our rights or the safety of users.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="small">
    Note: Third-party SDKs (such as analytics or ad SDKs) have their own data collection and privacy practices. We recommend reviewing their privacy policies where applicable.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, misuse, or disclosure. These measures include encryption in transit, secure storage practices, access controls, and routine security reviews.
    However, no system is completely secure and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We retain personal information and resume content only as long as necessary to provide the services you request, to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
    If you request deletion (see below), we will remove your personal data and resume content as described in Section 10, subject to any legal requirements to retain certain records.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You have the right to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access and review the personal information we hold about you.</li>
    <li>Request correction or deletion of personal data and resume content.</li>
    <li>Withdraw consent where processing is based on consent.</li>
    <li>Object to or restrict certain types of processing (where applicable).</li>
  </ul>

  </p>

  <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
