    <h1>Privacy Policy for AI Chart Trading Assistant</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 27, 2025</p>
    <p><strong>Organization:</strong> Profit AI Trading Bot Analysis</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the <strong>AI Chart Trading Assistant</strong> app by <strong>Profit AI Trading Bot Analysis</strong>. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, who we share it with, and your rights regarding that information. By using the app, you agree to the terms of this policy.</p>
        <p>This policy applies only to information collected by the iOS app and related services. It does not cover third-party websites or services linked from the app.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect the minimum information necessary to provide the app’s core functionality—analyzing chart images to generate market-sentiment predictions—and to maintain, improve, and secure the app.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User Content (Photos & Camera):</strong> When you take a picture or upload a chart image, that image is transmitted to our processing service (and/or third-party AI provider) solely to perform the requested analysis. We do not access your entire photo library; access occurs only with your explicit permission and only for the images you select or capture.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage & Analytics:</strong> Non-identifying information about how you use the app (e.g., features used, session length, crashes) to help us improve the app.</li>
            <li><strong>Device & Technical Data:</strong> Device model, iOS version, app version, and unique identifiers for analytics and crash reporting.</li>
            <li><strong>Support & Contact Data:</strong> If you contact support, we may retain your email address and message content to respond and troubleshoot issues.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use collected information to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide, maintain, and improve chart analysis features and market-sentiment predictions.</li>
            <li>Process uploaded images to generate AI-driven predictions and return results to you.</li>
            <li>Deliver customer support and respond to inquiries.</li>
            <li>Analyze usage to improve UI/UX, performance, and diagnose technical issues.</li>
            <li>Comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms of Use.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Important: Images you submit for analysis are processed to produce predictions. We do not use submitted images to train our models unless we obtain explicit prior consent, which will be clearly disclosed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. AI Processing & User Content</h2>
        <p>The app's AI features analyze the chart images you provide. This processing is necessary for the app’s core functionality.</p>
        <p>By default, data you enter or upload is processed locally or securely on our servers/third-party providers only when necessary for features like analysis. If you enable cloud backup or premium features, your data may be transmitted and stored securely.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Data Sharing and Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or trade your personal information. We may share data in limited situations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> Trusted third parties (e.g., AI processing like Vision GPT API, analytics, crash reporting, cloud storage, or Apple services) who help provide the app and are contractually bound to protect your data.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> When required by law, regulation, or legal process to protect our rights or the safety of users.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Third-party SDKs have their own privacy practices. Review their policies where applicable. Data transmitted to third parties is encrypted in transit (e.g., HTTPS).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures, including encryption in transit, secure storage, access controls, and routine security reviews, to protect your information from unauthorized access, misuse, or disclosure. However, no system is completely secure.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain user content, personal information, and other data only as long as necessary to provide services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce agreements. Submitted images are deleted or anonymized after processing and short-term needs. Contact us for deletion requests.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Access and review personal information we hold.</li>
            <li>Request correction or deletion of personal data and user content.</li>
            <li>Withdraw consent where processing is based on consent.</li>
            <li>Object to or restrict certain processing (where applicable).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To exercise these rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:tb.companyapps@gmail.com">tb.companyapps@gmail.com</a>. We'll respond as required by applicable law, including via Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework—we do not use IDFA for advertising.</p>
        <p>Camera & Photos permissions can be managed in iOS Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Camera/Photos. Analytics opt-out is available in app settings or by removing the app.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>The app is not intended for children under 13 (or higher local minimum age). We do not knowingly collect data from children. If you believe a child has provided information, contact us to delete it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>10. How to Delete or Export Your Data</h2>
        <p>Export analysis results via the app. For deletion of stored data, email <a href="mailto:tb.companyapps@gmail.com">tb.companyapps@gmail.com</a> with subject "Data Deletion Request." We will verify and comply per law.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>11. International Transfers</h2>
        <p>Data may be processed outside your country (e.g., to third-party providers). We protect it via contractual safeguards and applicable law.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>12. Legal Bases for Processing (EU/Applicable Jurisdictions)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Consent:</strong> For processing submitted images and camera/photos access.</li>
            <li><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> For analytics, security, and debugging (balanced against your rights).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>13. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this policy. Revised versions will have a new effective date. Continued use indicates acceptance.</p>
